   Overview <self>
   api

This package provides a multiset_ implementation for Python.

A multiset is similar to the builtin :class:`set`, but it allows an element to occur multiple times.
It is an unordered collection of element which have to be :term:`python:hashable` just like in a :class:`set`.
It supports the same :ref:`methods and operations <SetMethods>` as :class:`set` does, e.g. membership test, :meth:`union <set.union>`, :meth:`intersection <set.intersection>`, and
(:meth:`symmetric <set.symmetric_difference>`) :meth:`difference <set.difference>`. Multisets can be used in combination with regular sets for those operations.

The implementation is based on a :class:`dict` that maps the elements to their multiplicity in the multiset.
Hence, some :ref:`dictionary operations <DictMethods>` are supported.

In contrast to the :class:`collections.Counter` from the standard library, it has proper support for set
operations and only allows positive counts. Also, elements with a zero multiplicity are automatically
removed from the multiset.

There is currently no immutable version of the multiset, because there is no immutable version of :class:`dict`.

The package also uses the :mod:`typing` module for type hints (see :pep:`484`) so you can specify the type of a multiset like
``Multiset[ElementType]``. Furthermore, the :class:`Multiset` class also inherits from :class:`collections.abc.MutableSet` so that
it can be used anywhere a :class:`set` can be used.

API Overview
------------

The following is an overview over the methods of the :class:`Multiset` class. For more details on each method and some examples see
the autogenerated :doc:`api`.

.. class:: Multiset([mapping or iterable])

    Return a new multiset object whose elements are taken from
    the given optional iterable or mapping. If a mapping is given, it must have positive `int`
    values representing each element's multiplicity. If no iterable or mapping is specified, a new empty multiset is
    returned.

    The elements of a set must be :term:`python:hashable`. In contrast to regular sets, duplicate elements
    will not be removed from the multiset. 

    .. _SetMethods:

    The :class:`Multiset` class provides the following operations which the builtin :class:`set` also supports:

    .. describe:: len(s)

        Return the total number of elements in multiset *s* (cardinality of *s*).

        Note that this is the sum of the multiplicities and not not the number of distinct elements.
        Since the multiset is essentially a dict, the following can be used to get the number of distinct elements::

            >>> len(Multiset('aab').keys())
            2

    .. describe:: x in s

        Test *x* for membership in *s*.

    .. describe:: x not in s

        Test *x* for non-membership in *s*.

    .. method:: isdisjoint(other)

        Return ``True`` if the multiset has no elements in common with *other*.

    .. method:: issubset(other)
               multiset <= other

        Test whether every element in the multiset is in *other* and each element's multiplicity in the
        multiset is less than or equal to its multiplicity in *other*.

    .. method:: multiset < other

        Test whether the multiset is a proper subset of *other*, that is,
        ``multiset <= other and multiset != other``.

    .. method:: issuperset(other)
                multiset >= other

        Test whether every element in *other* is in the multiset and each element's multiplicity in *other*
        is less than or equal to its multiplicity in the multiset.

    .. method:: multiset > other

        Test whether the multiset is a proper superset of *other*, that is, ``multiset >=
        other and multiset != other``.

    .. method:: union(*others)
                multiset | other | ...

        Return a new multiset with elements from the multiset and all others. The maximal multiplicity over all
        sets is used for each element.

    .. method:: combine(*others)
                multiset + other + ...

        Return a new multiset with elements from the multiset and all others. Each element's multiplicities are summed
        up for the new set.

    .. method:: intersection(*others)
                multiset & other & ...

        Return a new multiset with elements common to the multiset and all others. The minimal multiplicity over all
        sets is used for each element.

    .. method:: difference(*others)
                multiset - other - ...

        Return a new multiset with elements in the multiset that are not in the others. This will subtract all the *others'*
        multiplicities and remove the element from the multiset if its multiplicity reaches zero.

    .. method:: symmetric_difference(other)
                multiset ^ other

        Return a new multiset with elements from either the multiset or *other* where their multiplicity is the absolute
        difference of the two multiplicities.

    .. method:: copy()
                Multiset(multiset)

        Return a new shallow copy of the multiset.

    .. method:: union_update(*others)
                multiset |= other | ...

        Update the multiset, adding elements from all others. The maximal multiplicity over all
        sets is used for each element.
        For a version of this method that works more closely to :meth:`dict.update`, see :meth:`update`. 

    .. method:: intersection_update(*others)
                multiset &= other & ...

        Update the multiset, keeping only elements found in it and all others. The minimal multiplicity over all
        sets is used for each element.

    .. method:: difference_update(*others)
                multiset -= other | ...

        Update the multiset, removing elements found in others. This will subtract all the *others'*
        multiplicities and remove the element from the multiset if its multiplicity reaches zero.

    .. method:: symmetric_difference_update(other)
                multiset ^= other

        Update the multiset, keeping only elements found in either the multiset or *other* but not both.
        The new multiplicity is the absolute difference of the two original multiplicities.

    .. method:: add(elem, multiplicity=1)
                s[elem] += multiplicity
                s[elem] = multiplicity

        Add element *elem* to the multiset *s*. If the optional multiplicity is specified, more than one
        element can be added at the same time by adding to its.

        Note that adding the same element multiple times will increase its multiplicity and thus change the multiset,
        whereas for a regular :class:`set` this would have no effect.

        You can also set the element's multiplicity directly via key assignment.

    .. method:: remove(elem, multiplicity=None)
                del s[elem]

        Remove all elements *elem* from the multiset.  Raises :exc:`KeyError` if *elem* is
        not contained in the set.
        
        If the optional multiplicity is specified, only the given
        number is subtracted from the element's multiplicity. This might still completely remove
        the element from the multiset depending on its original multiplicity.

        This method returns the original multiplicity of the element before it was removed.

        You can also delete the element  directly via key access.

    .. method:: discard(elem, multiplicity=None)
                s[elem] -= multiplicity
                s[elem] = 0

        Remove element *elem* from the set if it is present. If the optional multiplicity is specified, only the given
        number is subtracted from the element's multiplicity. This might still completely remove
        the element from the multiset depending on its original multiplicity.

        This method returns the original multiplicity of the element before it was removed.

        You can also set the element's multiplicity directly via key assignment.

    .. method:: clear()

        Remove all elements from the multiset.

    Note, the non-operator versions of :meth:`union`, :meth:`intersection`,
    :meth:`difference`, and :meth:`symmetric_difference`, :meth:`issubset`, and
    :meth:`issuperset`, :meth:`update`,
    :meth:`intersection_update`, :meth:`difference_update`, and
    :meth:`symmetric_difference_update` methods will accept any iterable as an argument.  In
    contrast, their operator based counterparts require their arguments to be
    sets.  This precludes error-prone constructions like ``Multiset('abc') & 'cbs'``
    in favor of the more readable ``Multiset('abc').intersection('cbs')``.

    The :class:`Multiset` supports set to set comparisons. Two
    multisets are equal if and only if every element of each multiset is contained in the
    other and each element's multiplicity is the same in both multisets (each is a subset
    of the other). A multiset is less than another set if and
    only if it is a proper subset of the second set (is a subset, but
    is not equal). A multiset is greater than another set if and only if it
    is a proper superset of the second set (is a superset, but is not equal).
    These comparisons work with both sets and multisets::

        >>> Multiset('ab') == {'a', 'b'}
        True

    Multiset elements, like dictionary keys, must be :term:`hashable`.

    Binary operations that mix :class:`set` or :class:`frozenset` instances with
    :class:`Multiset` instances will always return a :class:`Multiset`.

    .. _DictMethods:

    Since the :class:`Multiset` is also a :class:`dict`, it inherits some of its methods:

    .. describe:: s[elem]

        Return the multiplicity of *elem* in *s*. Returns ``0`` for elements that are not
        in the multiset.

    .. describe:: s[elem] = value

        Set the multiplicity of *elem* to *value*. Setting the multiplicity to ``0`` removes the element.

    .. describe:: del s[elem]

        See :meth:`remove`.

    .. describe:: iter(s)

        Return an iterator over the elements in the multiset.

        In contrast to both the :class:`dict` and :class:`set` implementations, this will repeat elements
        whose multiplicity is greater than ``1``::

            >>> sorted(Multiset('aab'))
            ['a', 'a', 'b']

        To only get distinct elements, use the :meth:`keys` method.

    .. classmethod:: fromkeys(elements, multiplicity)

        Create a new multiset with elements from *elements* and all multiplicities set to *multiplicity*.

    .. method:: get(elem, default)

        Return the multiplicity for *elem* if it is in the multiset, else *default*.

    .. method:: items()

        Return a new view of the multiset's items (``(elem, multiplicity)`` pairs).
        See the :ref:`documentation of dict view objects <dict-views>`.

        Note that this view is unordered.

    .. method:: keys()

        Return a new view of the multiset's distinct elements.  See the :ref:`documentation
        of dict view objects <dict-views>`.

        Note that this view is unordered.

    .. method:: update(*others)
                multiset += other + ...

        Update the multiset, adding elements from all others. Each element's multiplicities is summed up for the new multiset.
        For a version of this method that works more closely to the original :meth:`set.update`, see :meth:`union_update`. 

    .. method:: pop(elem, default)

        If *elem* is in the dictionary, remove it and return its multiplicity, else return
        *default*.

    .. method:: popitem()

        Remove and return an arbitrary ``(elem, multiplicity)`` pair from the multiset.

        :meth:`popitem` is useful to destructively iterate over a multiset. 
        If the multiset is empty, calling :meth:`popitem` raises a :exc:`KeyError`.

    .. method:: setdefault(elem, multiplicity)

        If *elem* is in the multiset, return its multiplicity.  If not, insert *elem*
        with a multiplicity of *multiplicity* and return *multiplicity*.

    .. method:: values()

        Return a new view of the multiset's multiplicities.  See the
        :ref:`documentation of dict view objects <dict-views>`.

        Note that this view is unordered.

    The multiset also adds some new methods for multiplying a multiset with an :class:`int` factor:
    
    .. method:: times(factor)
                multiset * factor

        Return a copy of the multiset where each multiplicity is multiplied by *factor*.
    
    .. method:: times_update(factor)
                multiset *= factor

        Update the multiset, multiplying each multiplicity with *factor*.
