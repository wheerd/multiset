Overview
--------

A multiset is similar to the builtin set_, but it allows an element to occur multiple times.
It is an unordered collection of elements which have to be hashable just like in a set_.
It supports the same methods and operations as set_ does, e.g. membership test, union, intersection, and
(symmetric) difference::

    >>> set1 = Multiset('aab')
    >>> set2 = Multiset('abc')
    >>> sorted(set1 | set2)
    ['a', 'a', 'b', 'c']

Multisets can be used in combination with sets_::

    >>> Multiset('aab') >= {'a', 'b'}
    True

Multisets are mutable::

    >>> set1.update('bc')
    >>> sorted(set1)
    ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c']

There is an immutable version similar to the frozenset_ which is also hashable::

    >>> set1 = FrozenMultiset('abc')
    >>> set2 = FrozenMultiset('abc')
    >>> hash(set1) == hash(set2)
    True
    >>> set1 is set2
    False

The implementation is based on a dict_ that maps the elements to their multiplicity in the multiset.
Hence, some dictionary operations are supported.

In contrast to the `collections.Counter`_ from the standard library, it has proper support for set
operations and only allows positive counts. Also, elements with a zero multiplicity are automatically
removed from the multiset.

Installation
------------

Installing `multiset` is simple with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_::
